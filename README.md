Miniproject 1: Image Classification

This homework was done in a group of two students: Valentin Borgeaud & Virginie Piskin

For this miniproject we used Keras library to create networks for image classification on:
- The MNIST dataset to classify handwritten numbers 
- The Fashion-MNIST dataset to classify clothing items

We compared the performances of the networks depending on the number of layers, the number of units per layer, regulizers, batch size and dropout.
